# Stock-Price-Prediction
The primary goal of this project is to create a simple and a basic stock market prediction model using Multiple linear regression.
In the real world, Stock market prediction is very complex, and it is a very challenging task as it is volatile and depends on numerous interrelated factors which makes it almost impossible to account for all the dependance factors. We have taken only a few significant features like open price, high price, low price, volume and created this model to 
predict our output, which is the close price.
